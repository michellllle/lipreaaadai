

## Usage 
To use the model, first you need to clone the repository: 
```git clone https://github.com/Chevinjeon/readinglips_c```

Then you can install the package:
```cd readinglips_c/```
```pip install -e```


## Dependencies 
* Keras 2.0+
* Tensorflow 1.0+ 
* PIP (for package installation)

## Note
* ```model.predict()``` expects a batch of inputs. There is only have one input that we are going to be passing through our model so we need to wrap it inside of another set of arrays.
  * For example, ```yhat = model.predict(tf.expand_dims(video, axis=0))``` will do this relatively easily. 
  * This will return our predictions, which we run through the Keras CTC Decoder.

## Non-Batched 
```
image = [[[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]...]
#Adds an extra axis, in effect batches 
batched = tf.expand_dims(image, axis=0)
```

## Batched
``` 
batched = [[[[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]...]]
```

## More on the Greedy Algorithm 
* the greedy algorithm to take the most probable prediction when it comes to generating the output:
*  ``` greedy = True ```
